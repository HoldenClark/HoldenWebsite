    <h1>StarCraft Counter Application</h1>
    <p>This is a counter application for the popular RTS game StarCraft. The primary function is keeping track of the total amount of games you have played, the amount of games that you have played with each faction that is playable in the game, and the win loss ratio you have for each faction and overall. You can select one of three factions to begin tracking your wins and losses after each game. You can switch factions at anytime as well as being able to reset the counts if necessary. Important features yet to be implemented are saving and loading your data so the application can be closed without losing track of important data.</p>
